Why use RNN instead of a standard nerual network for sequence data?
1. Inputs,ouptuts can be different lengths in different examples
2. Doesn't share featrues learned across different sequence data (e.g the different positons of text)

Recurrent Neural Netwrok (RNN)
 - Problem: it only uses the data before current data,
 - Solution: use bidirectional RNN
